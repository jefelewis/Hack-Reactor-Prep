What is the final value of x? Set the property in the "answer" object accordingly!

IMPORTANT: **DO NOT** just type this out manually then paste it into a terminal so the computer does the work for you.  That won't help you learn!! 

var x = 7;
var y = 8;
var z = 9;

x = y + z;
z = x;
x = y;
z = x + y;
y = z - x;
z = y;
x = y * z;
z = y/z;
x = (z - x)/(y + z);


Starter Code:
var answer = {
	finalValueOfX: null 
	// fill this in with your MENTALLY evaluated answer.
};
*/

// Answer:
