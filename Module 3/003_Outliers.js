PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.

1) Prepare to record & time:
Prepare your screencasting (both video and audio) setup all ready to go before de-obfuscating the problem statement.
Prepare an audible countdown timer (say, the Clock app on your phone).

2) Begin the problem:
Go to http://www.rot13.com/ and de-obfuscate the problem statement.
Paste the problem statement into the work area in Repl.it (replace the original, obfuscated version).
Start your timer for: 20 minutes / TWENTY MINUTES
Start recording.

3) Do the problem:
Follow the instructions from the sidebar titled "How to Run Your Interview".
Note: Since you are working by yourself, you have to mimic the live experience by asking rhetorical questions, then provisionally answering them yourself on behalf of your imaginary live interviewer. Ask those questions out loud anyway! 

4) Finish but DO NOT upload:
When you have a working solution that you are satisfied with OR when the timer goes off...
Stop recording.

5) Review your own work and record your notes here:
Watch your video and observe what you did well and what you want to improve for next time.
Write those notes here.

De-obfuscated Instructions:
Given a string of even and odd numbers, find which is the sole even number or the sole odd number.
The return value should be 1-indexed, not 0-indexed.

Examples :
detectOutlierValue("2 4 7 8 10"); // => 3 - Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
detectOutlierValue("1 10 1 1");  //=> 2 - Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
*/

function detectOutlierValue(input){
  // Your code here
}

detectOutlierValue("2 4 7 8 10");
detectOutlierValue("1 10 1 1");
