PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.

1) Prepare to record & time:
Prepare your screencasting (both video and audio) setup all ready to go before de-obfuscating the problem statement.
Prepare a timer.
Note that you have a little more time on this one...

2) Begin the problem:
Go to http://www.rot13.com/ and de-obfuscate the problem statement.
Paste the problem statement into the work area in Repl.it (replace the original, obfuscated version).
Start your timer for: 25 minutes / TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES
Start recording.

3) Do the problem
Follow the instructions from the sidebar titled "How to Run Your Interview".
Note: Since you are working by yourself, you have to mimic the live experience by asking rhetorical questions, then provisionally answering them yourself on behalf of your imaginary live interviewer. Ask those questions out loud anyway! 

4) Finish but DO NOT upload:
When you have a working solution that you are satisfied with OR when the timer goes off...
Stop recording.

5) Review your own work and record your notes here:
Watch your video and observe what you did well and what you want to improve for next time.
Write those notes here.

De-obfuscated Instructions:
You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.
e.g. transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);

Should return:
HW
EO
LR
LL
OD
*/

// STEPS TO SOLVE
// Input: Array
// Output: String
// Process: Take array input --> seprate the string at index 0 and index 1 --> Console.log array index 0, string index 0 + array index 1, string index 0 

function transposeTwoStrings(input){
  // Your code here
  
}

transposeTwoStrings(["Hello","World"]);

/* Output -->
HW
EO
LR
LL
OD
*/
